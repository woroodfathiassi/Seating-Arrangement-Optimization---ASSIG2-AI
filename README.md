# Seating Arrangement Optimization
---
This project explores the application of search algorithms to the problem of arranging guests around a round table. The goal is to minimize conflicts by placing individuals who dislike each other the least adjacent to one another.

Three search algorithms were implemented and compared: **Genetic Algorithm**, **Simulated Annealing**, and **Hill Climbing**. The results of these algorithms, along with their performance analysis, are detailed in the accompanying report.
